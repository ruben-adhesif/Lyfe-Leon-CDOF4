## Contribute

Go on the [GitHub page of the project](https://github.com/ruben-adhesif/Lyfe-Leon-CDOF4.git) and clic on the button `Fork` on the up-right corner
It's a best practice to give a name related to your improvement
From there, you can clone the project an change it as it was your own

```shell
git clone <fork_clone_link>
```

To do it from a Windows Terminal, it's like creating a new branch on your own project

```shell
git checkout -b <fork_name>
# OR
git branch <fork_name>
git checkout <fork_name>
```

Then, for both methodes, modify it as usuall

```shell
# make the willing changements
git add .
git commit -m "<commit_name>"
git push
```
